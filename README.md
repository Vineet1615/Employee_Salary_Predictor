**Employee Salary Predictor**
This project is a Machine Learning application designed to predict employee monthly salaries in Indian Rupees (INR) based on features like age, gender, years of experience, education level, and job title.

**Features**
- Uses a Random Forest Regressor model for accurate salary prediction.

- Processes a clean, realistic dataset of 1000+ employee records with monthly salary data.

- Includes feature engineering to encode categorical variables.

- Provides comprehensive data visualizations including salary distribution, correlation with age and experience, and group-wise average      salaries.

- Interactive web app built with Streamlit for easy use.

- Fully deployed on Streamlit Cloud for worldwide access.

- No dataset upload needed; app uses a built-in clean dataset by default.
